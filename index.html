        <h1>About Dementia</h1>
        <p>Dementia is a blanket term for a group of conditions that affect a person's memory and/or judegment. Someone living with Dementia may forget words, names, or recent events. They may struggle to pay attention or make simple decisions. They can get easily get confused or lost, even in familiar settings. This can be incredibly frustrating, and they may become easily upset and act out in strange ways. People with dementia may also say or do inappropriate or hurtful things. As dementia progresses, a person may lose the ability to communicate or do basic things by themselves.</p>
        <p>Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia. Other forms include Vascular dementia, Frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. Dementia can also be caused by other conditions such as head trauma, Huntingtonâ€™s disease or Parkinson's disease. A person can also be diagnosed with multiple types of dementia.</p>

        <h1>Why oranges?</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/">Alzheimer's Research UK</a> uses an orange as a symbol for dementia in their #ShareTheOrange campaign. During dementia, cells in the brain die. The affects of Alheimer's can leave the brain 140 grams (5 oz) lighter than a healthy one, which is about the weight of an orange.</p>

        <h1>About Dementia.cards</h1>
        <p>Dementia.cards is a project by <a href="http://iamteresalamb.com/">Teresa Lamb</a> to help raise awareness for people living with dementia. Her grandfather, Joe, was diagnised with Alzheimer's disease in 2015, and her father, Danny, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2017. Teresa's goal was to design better companion cards for caregivers of people with dementia. These cards could be passed out to give new people more insight into any unusual behavior, and hopefully create more dementia-friendly environments.</p>
        <p>This site is a work in progress. More info and resources will be added soon.</p>
